This directory contains the notebooks that were used within the Azure Quantum
platform to construct the circuits, send them to hardware, retrieve the data,
then process the results. API keys and job IDs have been removed from some of
the cells and cell outputs. The raw data itself can be found in the
`hardware-data-processing` directory.
